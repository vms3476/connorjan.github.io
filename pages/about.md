I currently am a fifth year student at [RIT](http://rit.edu){: target="_blank" style="color: #f36e21;"}, and
am in the [BS/MS program](http://www.rit.edu/kgcoe/program/bsms-electrical-engineering){: target="_blank"} in Electrical Engineering.
There are several areas of focus to choose from in the MS degree program and I am in the Digital Design path.

I am very interested in Hardware Engineering, Digital Logic Design, Embedded Systems, and Software,
however, my main goal is to get some great experiences by learning and bringing my own experience to the table.

I recently finished a co-op at [Harris](/blog/2016/08/19/harris-co-op/){:style="color: #E21D22;"} and learned a lot while working on some really cool things.

### Interests
I love sports (namely <a href="http://www.rit.edu/sg/rball" target="_blank">Racquetball</a>, Hockey, and Swimming), 
I enjoy <a href="http://www.geocaching.com" target="_blank">Geocaching</a>, Rubik's Cubes and other puzzles, backing projects on <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, and many other fun things! 
I also *really* enjoy programming and am very familiar with a bunch of languages but am most proficient with Verilog, Python, and C++.
