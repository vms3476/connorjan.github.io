# Welcome!

I'm Victoria. As a recent graduate of [Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT)](http://rit.edu){: target="_blank" style="color: #f36e21;"}, I am looking forward to spending a year abroad in Switzerland for a Fulbright fellowship! I will be doing research with remote sensing scientists at the [University of ZÃ¼rich (UZH)](http://www.uzh.ch/) to evaluate and improve LiDAR forest mapping techniques. 

This [blog](/blog) is where I will be documenting some observations, experiences, and photographs from my travels.  

For more information, you can learn more [about me](/about) and my past [projects](/projects).

Please note: This is not an official Department of State website or blog, and the views and information presented are my own and do not represent the Fulbright Program of the U.S. Department of State.
