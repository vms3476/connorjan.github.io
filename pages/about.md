Recently graduated with a B.S. from [Rochester Institute of Technology](http://rit.edu){: target="_blank" style="color: #f36e21;"} in [Motion Picture Science](https://cias.rit.edu/schools/film-animation/undergraduate-motion-picture-science){: target="_blank" style="color: #f36e21;"} and [Imaging Science](https://www.cis.rit.edu/){: target="_blank" style="color: #f36e21;"}. This unique [double major](http://www.rit.edu/news/story.php?id=55758) allowed me to develop a diverse skillset spanning the scientific world of remote sensing, the artistic side of the film industry, and everything related to imaging in between them.
